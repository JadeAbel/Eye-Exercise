# Eyes

## Eye Exercise

In my best MJ voice - "I always feel like somebody's watching me".

Project Title: Eye Exercise
Description: As you move your pointer across the screen, the eyes follow. This movement is performed using the 'onmouseover' event. The eyes were created using CSS.

Usage: FUN

HOW TO RUN: Open the index.html file on your browser. You may need to clone this repository to your machine.

Support: Email jade.marie.abel@gmail.com

Roadmap: In the future, there could be more eyes. Different CSS styling or imported images could be used so that there are different pairs of eyes (lion, tiger, bear etc.).
